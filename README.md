## Hi there! I am Nur Abunamus ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at Dokuz Eylul University. My journey into the world of web development started with a coding boot camp at <strong> Gaza Sky Geeks </strong> in Palestine.
  
  Subsequently, I gained valuable experience through an internship at <strong>Google For Startups</strong>  and later served as a coding trainer with <strong>Mercy Corps </strong>. These experiences have solidified my passion for web development and its potential to drive innovation.
